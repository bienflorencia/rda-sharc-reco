Promoting RRA,"Participate in building & promoting relevant frameworks and initiatives related to responsible research assessment (e.g., join forums such as the CoARA: Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment)",Sign CoARA Agreement,https://coara.eu/
Engaging with OS communities,"Be part of the OS conversation by joining relevant communities, such as the Research Data Alliance",List of OS communities of practice,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CuO7ZjJUuMGvvMmRfnXfPbvTnfWc5lO4oFE2U22nAic/edit#gid=1718200050
Adopting formal OS policies,Establish institutional prerequisites to enable the practice of OS,,
,"* Post institutional OS policies in a visible and easy to find place (website), including all facets of OS (publications, data, software, citizen science)",,
,"* Mandate deposit of ALL research outputs (e.g., publications, datasets, code) in the institutional or other compliant repository to be publicly available under an open licence (no later than the time of an associated publication, as much as possible)",OS at Finnish Meteorological Institute,https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-science
,"In case of legitimate constraints - 'dark' deposit with open metadata. 'A 'dark' deposit (or restricted deposit) is a work in a repository whose full text stays hidden from the public (not OA). However, metadata associated with these deposits is publicly accessible so that authors' scholarly records are discoverable",,
,"* Mandate for a DMP/software management plan for all research projects, which the staff/postgraduate students are involved in",,
,* Require to manage research data in line with the FAIR principles,,
,* Ensure that all publications (co)-authored by the staff/postgraduate students contain data availability statements,,
,* Encourage that the staff/postgraduate students retain sufficient IP rights to comply with the OA requirements,Harvard University's Rights Retention policy,https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/
,,UK Institutional Rights Retention policies  ,https://sje30.github.io/rrs/rrs.html
,* Minimise the administrative burden generated by some OS activities and provide support to facilitate these steps while promoting trust and transparency,,
,"Include criteria for open research activities in recruitment, evaluation and rewarding policies ",,
,* Consider/create indicators (qualitative and/or quantitative) in general as well as disciplinary data-level metrics for crediting data sharing in the evaluation schemes ,CoARA agreement on RRA ,https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf

,"* Organise institutional working groups, workshops",,
,"* Provide digital training materials, newsletters",,
,* Ensure that the various facets of OS are coherently developed and do not work in silos,,
