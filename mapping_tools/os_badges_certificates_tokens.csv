ResearchHub,"The goal of the platform is to make a modern mobile and web application where people can collaborate on scientific research in a more efficient way, similar to what GitHub has done for software engineering.  To incentivize users, ResearchHub issues tokens that users can earn and transfer to one another by sharing, curating, and discussing topics within the platform. Users can also transfer tokens to one another on the platform by creating “bounties” to incentivize other users to engage with their post. Rewards for contributions are proportionate to how valuable the community perceives the actions to be - as measured by upvotes.",All researchers,https://www.researchhub.com/about,reputational,
