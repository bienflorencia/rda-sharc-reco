---

## Adopt formal policies requiring/strongly encouraging OS activities

## Adopt relevant frameworks and initiatives related to responsible research assessment 

**Suggestions**: [RoRI Working Paper 'The changing role of funders in responsible research assessment' (2020)](https://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_changing_role_of_funders_in_responsible_research_assessment_progress_obstacles_and_the_way_ahead/13227914) | [Statement of transforming research assessment] | [Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment](https://coara.eu/) | 

## Monitor the compliance for open science implementation and make it transparent to relevant stakeholders 

## Recognise well-documented, FAIR and open digital outputs as first-class contributions to the scientific record during the project lifecycle

## Create calls financing OS driven activities and calls financing re-use of data

## Target systematically part of the budget to open science activities

## Ensure that enough funding be dedicated to appropriate resources for staff and open science infrastructure devoted to the development of shared data platforms 
i.e., with standardisation, quality control and analysis tools services that will enable real-time use of data within a project collaboration, and future reuse by all.
