Examples: Institutional rights-retention policies Harvard University | University of Edinburgh\n\n\nDevelop and implement rewarding policies:\n\nBoost appreciation of the researchers with good RDM & OS practices with well-documented, FAIR and open digital outputs, in their annual reviews by including OS activities (such as those described in introduction) into the institutional research evaluation scheme.\n\nConsider/create performance indicators (quantitative and/or qualitative) in general as well as disciplinary data-level metrics for crediting data sharing in the evaluation schemes. Examples: Best Practices EC Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) | TU DELFT Open Science programme | Utrecht University policy on Recognition and Rewards | BIH QUEST programme\n\nPromote that non-OA (closed) outputs not be reported for performance evaluation procedures. Examples: Best Practices CNRS policy\nCreate data champions schemes.\n\nCreate Open Science stamp/badge/label in a PhD Degree Certificate. Examples: Compilation of Visibility cases"
