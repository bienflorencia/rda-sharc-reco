    "text": "- Adopt formal policies requiring/strongly encouraging OS activities.\n\nInstitutional prerequisites to enable the practise of OS:\n\nmandate deposit of ALL research outputs (e.g., publications, datasets, code) in the institutional or other compliant repository to be publicly available under an open license (no later than the time of an associated publication, as much as possible), in case of legitimate constraints - ‘dark’* deposit with open metadata. (*) A ‘dark’ deposit (or restricted deposit) is a work in a repository whose full text stays hidden from the public (not OA). However, metadata associated with these deposits is publicly accessible so that authors’ scholarly records are discoverable\n\nmandate for a DMP/software management plan for all research projects, which the staff/postgraduate students are involved in.\n\nrequire to manage research data in line with the FAIR principles.\n\nensure that all publications (co)-authored by the staff/postgraduate students contain Data Availability Statements.\n\nencourage that the staff/postgraduate students retain sufficient IP rights to comply with the OA requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Institutional rights-retention policies\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard University, University of Edinburgh\n\n\n\n\nDevelop and implement rewarding policies:\n\nboost appreciation of the researchers with good RDM & OS practices with well-documented, FAIR and open digital outputs, in their annual reviews by including OS activities (such as those described in introduction) into the institutional research evaluation scheme.\n\nconsider/create performance indicators (quantitative and/or qualitative) in general as well as disciplinary data-level metrics for crediting data sharing in the evaluation schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices examples\n\n\n\n\n\nEC Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM), TU DELFT Open Science programme, Utrecht University policy on Recognition and Rewards, BIH QUEST programme\n\n\n\n\npromote that non-OA (closed) outputs not be reported for performance evaluation procedures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices examples\n\n\n\n\n\nCNRS policy\n\n\n\n\nCreate data champions schemes.\n\nCreate Open Science stamp/badge/label in a PhD Degree Certificate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nVisibility\n\n\n\n\n\n- Provide OS capacity building support:\n\nProvide OS courses (as part of the annual mandatory training for research staff and mandatory subjects for postgraduate students).\n\nOrganise institutional working groups, workshops.\n\nProvide digital training materials, newsletters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices & resources training, UNESCO’s index\n\n\n\n\nEstablish dedicated human resources/units, such as data stewards & managers, and engage libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practice\n\n\n\n\n\nTU Delft Data Stewardship project and Data Champions initiative, CNRS DDOR\n\n\n\n\n\n- Provide infrastructure and material resources for OS\n\nProvide or work with a trusted repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practice\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository certification based on CoreTrustSeal, Nestor Seal DIN31644 or ISO16363 (see the EC’s expectations for trusted repositories in the Horizon Europe Annotated Model Grant Agreement, pp. 155-156), CNRS DDOR\n\n\n\n\nProvide digital services & tools (e.g., DMP tool; FAIR data management, anonymisation, analysis tools)\n\n\n\n- Provide financial support for OS:\n\nCosts related to PIDs, such as DOIs, registration for all research outputs, including datasets.\nAPCs (excluding hybrid journals), transformative agreement costs.\n\nCosts associated with research data/software management.\n\nInvestments in national/regional OS initiatives, such as Diamond OA initiatives (if any).\n\n\n\n- Create other types of rewards\n\nCo-work chances with related OS groups and people.\n\nFree time (sabbatical time).\n\nGifts.\n\nSalary bonus."
