    "text": "Institutional prerequisites to enable the practise of OS:\n\nMandate deposit of ALL research outputs (e.g., publications, datasets, code) in the institutional or other compliant repository to be publicly available under an open license (no later than the time of an associated publication, as much as possible), in case of legitimate constraints - dark1 deposit with open metadata.\nMandate for a DMP/software management plan for all research projects, which the staff/postgraduate students are involved in.\n\nRequire to manage research data in line with the FAIR principles.\n\nEnsure that all publications (co)-authored by the staff/postgraduate students contain Data Availability Statements.\n\nEncourage that the staff/postgraduate students retain sufficient IP rights to comply with the OA requirements. Examples: Institutional rights-retention policies Harvard University | University of Edinburgh\n\n\nDevelop and implement rewarding policies:\n\nBoost appreciation of the researchers with good RDM & OS practices with well-documented, FAIR and open digital outputs, in their annual reviews by including OS activities (such as those described in introduction) into the institutional research evaluation scheme.\n\nConsider/create performance indicators (quantitative and/or qualitative) in general as well as disciplinary data-level metrics for crediting data sharing in the evaluation schemes. Examples: Best Practices EC Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) | TU DELFT Open Science programme | Utrecht University policy on Recognition and Rewards | BIH QUEST programme\n\nPromote that non-OA (closed) outputs not be reported for performance evaluation procedures. Examples: Best Practices CNRS policy\nCreate data champions schemes.\n\nCreate Open Science stamp/badge/label in a PhD Degree Certificate. Examples: Compilation of Visibility cases"

Refer to templates for detailed information. Example: AGU\n\n\nAcknowledge OS contributorship\n\n\nRecognise all kind of contributorship early in the projects. Example: Acknowledging Contributors - The Turing Way\n\nUse the CRediT taxonomy:\n\nAllocate the terms appropriately to your own contribution and to contributors within research outputs.\n\nAdvocate that your institution and any publications you’re submitting to acknowledge and adopt the taxonomy. Example: Implementing CRediT\n\n\n\nCite or acknowledge other’s OS activities using DOis or other PIDs\n\n\nInclude data citations for all research data you used in the References section of your paper.\n\nAcknowledge any OS tool you may use , e.g. with their identifier or ‘How to cite’ statement (if any).
