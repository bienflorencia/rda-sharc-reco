### Maximise your visibility citation out of your open science work

#### 1. Pre-requisite on digital presence: 

  - Maximise as much as possible your digital presence using PID for you and for all your outputs (ex/ ORCID, DOI or other identifier for OA publications / OA datasets/ Open source software.  
**More information**: [Parsec Digital Presence checklist](https://zenodo.org/record/7071677#.Y-9Ms3bMK5c) | [Unesco](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/receive-credit-all-your-contributions-science).
  - Update your cv & reporting activities with your OS activites.  

#### 2. Make your data & outputs citable

  - Include citation elements for research data/software you created in the References section of your paper. To support indexing and reuse:   
    - Use American Psychological Association (APA) style.  
    - Include a persistent identifier (DOI), preferred, or URL.  
    - Use labels/bracketed descriptions (e.g., [Dataset], [Software], [Collection], [ComputationalNotebook]).  
  - Include a data/software availability statement in your paper that describes where and how your data are available, and how to cite them if possible. Refer to templates for detailed information.  
[Templates and **More information**](https://data.agu.org/resources/availability-citation-checklist-for-authors)

#### 3. Acknowledge OS contributorship

  - Recognise all kind of contributorship early in the projects  
**More information**: [Acknowledging Contributors - The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement.html)
  - Use the CRediT taxonomy:
    - Allocate the terms appropriately to your own contribution and to contributors within research outputs.  
    - Advocate that your institution and any publications you're submitting to acknowledge and adopt the taxonomy.  
**More information**: [Implementing CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/implementing-credit/)


#### 4. Cite or acknowledge other's OS activities using DOis or other PIDs

  - Include data citations for all research data you used in the References section of your paper.  
  - Acknowledge any OS tool you may use , e.g. with their  identifier or "How to cite" statement (if any).  
**More information**: [RDA WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/national-pid-strategies-wg)

### Get financial reward or support

  - Apply to specific funds for OS activities if any  
  - Apply to OS prize/awards if any
