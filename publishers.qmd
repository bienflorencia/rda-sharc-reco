## Require that authors include systematically their ORCIDs in all research outputs
 
## Adopt the CRediT taxonomy
**More information**: [Implementing CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/implementing-credit/) | [Research Artifact Citation](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Research_Artifact_Citation)

## Adopt the Open Science badges initiative

**More information**: [Center for Open Science Badges](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges)
 
## Find ways to recognise peer-reviews related work

## Encourage OA publishing in all LMICs[^1] by revising the criteria for publishing fees and adjust it using meaningful indicators

**For instance**: To the national Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) and not only to the country GDP (e.g. Uruguay is considered high income country although science funding is  [0.48% of total GDP in 2019](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS))
