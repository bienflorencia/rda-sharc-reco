The first section (A) guides researchers on practices they should adopt to maximise their recognition for their open science efforts. Sections (B-F) include recommended mechanisms that funders, institutions, evaluation committees, publishers can follow.


## Sections
A. [Recognition at the individual level (researcher / student / technician)](/individual)  
B. [Recommendations to institutions (research performing organisations)](/institutions)  
C. [Recommendations to funders](/funders)    
D. [Recommendations to publishers](/publishers)  
E. [Recommendations to government policy makers](/policy-makers)   


## Examples of OS activities
  - preregistration of the study design, methods, hypothesis, etc. prior to commencing the research
  - sharing a research manuscript/preprint (as the first step of a peer-review process)
  - publishing a paper or monograph/book as Open Access
  - making research data open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable)
  - making the code (e.g., software, models, algorithms, workflows) openly available
  - open peer review (e.g., being reviewed or the reviewer)
  - outreach and public engagement in science, including citizen science
  - teaching/training open science
